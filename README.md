# Sense and Ansibility

This is an example Django project that showcases the conventions intended to make
deployment with Ansible a breeze. As such, it's also, in a way, documentation on
those conventions, and, since it's versioned, serves as a record of their history.

It will need to co-evolve with our Ansible recipes.

To deploy this project with Ansible, check out the STANDALONE_DJANGO_README.md in the Ansible repo.

# Notes

## Settings

A template for a local_settings.py is maintained in the Ansible repo.
